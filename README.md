# CE-Objects-Labs

Creating a new platform to detect Connected environment objects 
the platform will include CSS for desiging the Web page 
Javascript for connecting to tensarflow (libarariy) compiler/notebook with all the Machine learning process for detecting the CE Lab objects 
the goal is to let new arrivels guests and staff and students to engage with the object that around the lab and to know who build them 
what skill they had been used to excute this project ETC

the main goal in this project is to create a decent model of object detection and detect the CE lab objects 

im goin to use transfer learning that is it a pretraind model that based on the image classification project that i had been doing in edge impulse 

im going to feel the gap of the last process of the image classification and add images that will achive  200 images of each object and 100 images of both of them
